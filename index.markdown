##### PearceLab @ LiU
# Welcome to the D<sub>3</sub>MS Group 

In the Data-Driven Determination of Macromolecular Structures (D3MS) group, we develop new experimental and computational approaches to unravel the subtleties of protein structures and achieve unprecendented levels of detail in macromolecular models.

We use a variety of computational and experimental approaches, from mathematical models to machine learning, and from crystallography to cryoEM. What connects all of these methods is the idea that *our decisions are driven by the data*.

We are part of the [bioinformatics division](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ifm/bioin) at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en), and we collaborate closely with colleagues in the [Wallenberg Centre for Molecular Medicine (WCMM) at Linköping](https://liu.se/en/research/wcmm). We are part of the national Swedish [SciLifeLab network](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/about/).
