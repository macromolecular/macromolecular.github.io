# Welcome to the D<sub>3</sub>MS Group 
**(Sometimes known as PearceLab @ LiU)**

In the Data-Driven Determination of Macromolecular Structures (D3MS) group, we develop new experimental and computational approaches to unravel the subtleties of protein structures and achieve unprecendented levels of detail in macromolecular models.

We use a variety of computational and experimental approaches, from mathematical models to machine learning, and from crystallography to cryoEM. We use these tools to design new ways of determining macromolecular structures that reveals more about how they function. 

What connects all of our methods is the idea that *decisions should be driven by the data*.

We are part of the [bioinformatics division](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ifm/bioin) at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en), and we collaborate closely with colleagues in the [Wallenberg Centre for Molecular Medicine (WCMM) at Linköping](https://liu.se/en/research/wcmm). We are part of the national Swedish [SciLifeLab network](https://www.scilifelab.se/) as part of the [Data-Driven Life Sciences (DDLS) program](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/about/).
