### Welcome to the D<sub>3</sub>MS Group (PearceLab @ LiU)

In the Data-Driven Determination of Macromolecular Structures (D3MS) group at Link√∂ping University, we develop new experimental and computational approaches to unravel the subtleties of protein structures and improving level of detail in macromolecular models.

We use a variety of computational and experimental approaches, from mathematical models to machine learning, and from crystallography to cryoEM.
