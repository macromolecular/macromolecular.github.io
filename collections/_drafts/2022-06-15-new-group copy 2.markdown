I'm excited to announce that as of 1st October, I will be starting my own research group in Link√∂ping in Sweden. I am excited to be part of the SciLifeLab initiative, as a [Data-Driven Life Sciences (DDLS)](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/fellows/) fellow. 

I will be working to make structural biology more data driven by developing new data-driven approaches to structure determination using advanced data science and machine learning techniques. These will focus on qualitatively and quantitatively characterising the flexibility of macromolecules from structural data, with an aim to changing the way that we routinely determine macromolecular structures. As such, we sit at the intersection between physics, biochemistry and data science.

As part of the initial funding, I have 2 PhDs and 2 postdocs positions available, and am looking for people to join the team!
