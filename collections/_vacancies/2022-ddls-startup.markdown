Thanks to funding from the [Wallenburg foundation](https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en) through the [DDLS program](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/about/), I am looking for two PhD candidates and two postdocs to join my group.

These positions will be tailored to the successful applicant's skills, in the following projects: 
- Multi-dataset analysis: developing new approaches for extracting weak signal from macromolecular electron density. For our previous work, see the [PanDDA](http://pandda.bitbucket.io/pandda/) webpage.
- Disorder and flexibility analysis: developing new approaches for extracting and characterising flexibility in experimental macromolecular structures. For our previous work, see the [ECHT](https://pandda.bitbucket.io/pandemic/echt.html) webpage.
- Multi-dataset analysis of protein dynamics: developing new multi-dataset approaches for modelling crystallographic and cryo-EM macromolecular structures.
- Statistical methods of model building and decision making in macromolecular crystallography/cryo-EM.

Master's students are also invited to do their projects in the group and work on the above projects.
