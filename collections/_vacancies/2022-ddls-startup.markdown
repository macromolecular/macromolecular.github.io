Thanks to funding from the [Wallenberg foundation](https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en) through the [DDLS program](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/about/), I am looking for two PhD candidates and two postdocs to join my group. These positions are not yet officially advertised, but you can drop me an email with your CV if you're interested and I'll contact you when the official adverts are available.

These positions will be tailored to the successful applicant's skills, in the following projects: 
- **Multi-dataset analysis**: developing new approaches for extracting weak signal from macromolecular electron density. For our previous work, see the [PanDDA](http://pandda.bitbucket.io/pandda/) webpage.
- **Disorder and flexibility analysis**: developing new approaches for extracting and characterising flexibility in experimental macromolecular structures. For our previous work, see the [ECHT](https://pandda.bitbucket.io/pandemic/echt.html) webpage.
- **Multi-dataset analysis of protein dynamics**: developing new multi-dataset approaches for modelling crystallographic and cryo-EM macromolecular structures.
- **Statistical methods of model building and decision making** in macromolecular crystallography/cryo-EM.

Master's students are also invited to do their projects in the group and work on the above projects.
