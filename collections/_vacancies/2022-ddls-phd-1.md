I'm looking for a PhD student to develop statistical and machine learning approaches **to analyze and improve modelling of disordered regions of macromolecular atomic models derived from multi-dataset X-ray crystallography experiments**. 

Working with both national and international experimental collaborators, you will apply these methods to study the role of flexibility and dynamics in relation to molecular recognition and function using data from time-resolved, multi-temperature and fragment screening crystallography experiments.
