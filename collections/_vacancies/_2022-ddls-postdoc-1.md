I'm looking for a postdoc to develop statistical and machine learning approaches **to characterize and quantify flexibility in macromolecular atomic models determined by cryo-EM and crystallography experiments**. 

Using national Swedish & SciLifeLab computing infrastructure, you will apply these methods at scale to structures in the PDB, to build a publicly-accessible open database and study experimental flexibility in relation to molecular function. We will then use this database to explore macromolecular flexibility at scale.
