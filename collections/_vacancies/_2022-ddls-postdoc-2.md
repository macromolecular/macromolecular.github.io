I'm looking for a postdoc to use statistical and machine learning approaches **to develop methods for improving modelling and refinement of heterogeneous regions of macromolecular atomic models derived from multi-dataset crystallography experiments**. 

You will use these approaches to generate highly detailed models that enable quantitative structural studies of multi-state systems, such as protein-ligand complexes obtained from fragment-screening experiments. You will engage with national & international collaborators to apply these methods to time-resolved and multi-temperature experimental data sets.
