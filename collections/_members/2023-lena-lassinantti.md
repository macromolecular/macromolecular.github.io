Lena obtained her undergraduate degree in Biomedicine from Umea University 2017. She then worked on her PhD in Biochemistry in the group of [Ronnie Berntsson](https://www.umu.se/forskning/grupper/ronnie-berntsson/ ) at the same university between 2017-2022. Since she was the first PhD student in the Berntsson lab, she was part of setting up several methods for the group. Lena was also teaching during her PhD and has been the chair of one of the PhD councils at Umea University. She burns for scientific outreach and has both made a [video pitch](https://www.umu.se/en/news/awards-for-the-best-video-research-pitch-presentations_9815627/) and been part of the [European Researchers’ Night](https://issuu.com/vetenskapoallm/docs/forskarfredag2020). Lena is now a Postdoc in the Data-Driven Determination of Macromolecular Structures (D3MS) group, where she is excited to take a dive into the dynamic world of macromolecules.
