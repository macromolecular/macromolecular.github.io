Ylva is in her final year of engineering studies at Link√∂ping University, pursuing a Master's in Chemical Biology with a particular focus on Computer Science and Statistics/Machine Learning. While studying, she has accumulated several years of experience as a teaching assistant in programming, where she found great delight in both teaching and learning about coding. Ylva loves problem-solving, particularly when she can use and develop computational tools for the job, and is thrilled by the prospect of combining this with everything macromolecular as a Research Assistant in the Data-Driven Determination of Macromolecular Structures (D3MS) group.
