Nic earned his Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry from the University of Toledo in 2016. After graduating he worked in the lab of Timothy Mueser. He then ventured to Seattle, where he immersed himself in the world of crystallography at UCB Pharma and contributed to the Structural Genomics Consortium SSGCID. While there, he earned a Master's degree in Bioinformatics from the University of Maryland in 2021. Today, as a doctoral student, Nicholas is fueled by a profound passion for harnessing modern computational and machine learning techniques to further our understanding in structural biology.
