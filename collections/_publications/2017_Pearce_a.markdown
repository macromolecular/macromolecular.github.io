The PanDDA (Pan-Dataset Density Analysis) method identifies partial-occupancy features in crystallographic data, such as weakly-binding ligands. These appear at sub-unitary occupancy in the crystal and are thus hard to detect and model. 

We developed an approach where we build a statistical model of a set of crystallographic datasets and finds binding ligands by finding electron density outliers from the population. We then apply a background correction to account for the partial occupancy of the ligand and present density for the ligand so that it can be modelled.
